## Database Seeding

When you pull any changes off the repo, be sure to update your database with
what is defined in seed.sql

seed.sql should contain the following:

1. Dropping existing tables
2. Adding tables
3. Seeding tables with values

As we are currently creating new components and assembling them together, the
schema is incomplete. A *TODO* will be to add the foreign key requirements and
updates to the schema so that it concisely represents our requirements.

## Workflow

Work off your own branch, and merge to master as you see fit.
